> **"Privacy is not a crime. It's a right."**

## /// MISSION BRIEF
**Ghost Market UI** is a front-end e-commerce concept designed for a fictional "Grey Market" hardware store. It specializes in privacy tools, pentesting gadgets, and secure communication devices.

Unlike standard e-commerce templates, this project focuses on **Dark Mode Aesthetics**, **Cyberpunk/Hacker vibes**, and a **Tracker-Free** user experience.

## ⚡ KEY FEATURES

### 1. Dynamic Shopping Cart (State Management)
- **Real-time Calculation:** Pure JavaScript algorithm handles item additions, quantity adjustments, and total price calculation without page reloads.
- **Side-Panel UX:** A responsive, right-sliding sidebar cart that provides a seamless user experience (inspired by modern SaaS tools).
- **Persistent Overlay:** Focuses user attention when the cart is active.

### 2. "Cyber-Secure" Aesthetics
- **Neon Glow Effects:** CSS `box-shadow` and `text-shadow` used to create a terminal-like atmosphere.
- **Responsive Grid:** CSS Grid & Flexbox ensure the layout breaks down perfectly from 4K monitors to mobile screens.
- **Custom Assets:** Replaced heavy images with lightweight, scalable FontAwesome icons with neon styling for performance.

### 3. Clean Code Architecture
- **No Frameworks:** Built with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. No React/Vue bloat.
- **Semantic HTML:** SEO-friendly structure.
- **Optimized CSS:** Heavy use of CSS Variables (`:root`) for easy theme management.
